1. Incorporating herein by reference the data and documentation given for the project. I will not
repeat the data/documentation given, but focus on the post-processing done on that data by me.

2. First, The test Activity and Subject data is merged with the test data. Then the training 
Activity and Subject data is merged with and training data. 

3. Then the test and training datasets (fron 2 above) are merged together to 
yield one data set. In the merge the TRAINING dataset is placed ahead of TEST data
TRAINING data occupies the first 7352 rows and the 2947 rows of the TEST data starts from row 7353 
onwards through row 10299.

4. 88 columns fron the 563 columns in the original data were extracted. These were selected by the
occurence of the terms mean and/or standard deviation in their descriptors. Column #s of the 
extracted columns are listed in "INDEX OF EXTRACTED COLUMNS" included in this README file. The columns
for Subject and Activity were collapsed into one column, this leaves a total of 87 columns in
the output tidy data set. For the other 86 columns, the mean of the observations perataining to
each Subject and Activity was computed to collapse the rows. With 30 subjects and 6 activity types
this results in a tidy dataset with 180 rows and 87 columns. The computed 86 columns are listed below 
"INDEX OF COMPUTED COLUMNS" along with an English description of what they mean.
