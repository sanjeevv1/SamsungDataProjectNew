# SamsungDataProjectNew
This is the repo containing the code, codebooks and README files for the Samsung Wearables
data extraction project. The run_analysis.R file has the R code for the data extraction.
There are three files that describe the code and data and should be read in order: 1) "Samsung
Code Book" describes the processing done on the data 2) "README_run_analysis" describes how the
code works and 3) "Columns.txt" describes the columns of the output tidy data set.
